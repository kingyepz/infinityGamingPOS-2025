build tournament support in Infinity Gaming Lounge POS, focusing on EAFC 25/26 tournaments, here’s a breakdown of how to handle Round Robin and Group + Knockout formats, and what the build should look like:

🎮 Tournament Formats
1. Round Robin

Every player/team plays against every other player/team once.

Points system:

Win = 3 points

Draw = 1 point

Loss = 0 points

Standings table automatically updates (Wins, Losses, Draws, Goals For, Goals Against, Goal Difference, Points).

At the end: the player/team with the highest points wins, or top X advance to finals if needed.

2. Group + Knockout (Champions League Style)

Group Stage:

Players/teams are divided into groups (e.g., 4 players per group).

Round Robin inside each group.

Top 1 or 2 advance.

Knockout Stage:

Single elimination bracket (Quarterfinals → Semifinals → Final).

Option to add a 3rd place playoff.

Matches tracked until one champion remains.
